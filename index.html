                <p>
                    Our users struggle with maintaining the location of their locked bikes and often suffer from theft. Our solution should enable users to track the location of their bikes through a GPS system in order to always know where they left it and to find out where a thief may have taken it.

                    My team and I created an affinity diagram to brainstorm ideas and the different aspects of tracking our users' bike location.
